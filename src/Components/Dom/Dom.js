    What is the DOM?
    <ul>
        <li>
        The DOM is a programming interface for web documents.
        </li>
        <li>
        It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    DOM as a Tree Structure
    <ul>
        <li>
        The DOM represents a document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the document.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Nodes
    <ul>
        <li>
        There are different types of nodes: element nodes, text nodes, attribute nodes, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        Element nodes represent HTML or XML elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Manipulating the DOM
    <ul>
        <li>
        JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM to dynamically change content, structure, and styles.
        </li>
        <li>
        Common methods include getElementById, querySelector, appendChild, removeChild, etc.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Events
    <ul>
        <li>
        The DOM can detect user actions (events) like clicks, key presses, mouse movement, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        Event listeners can be added to nodes to handle these events.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Performance Considerations
    <ul>
        <li>
        Direct manipulation of the DOM can be slow and should be minimized.
        </li>
        <li>
        Virtual DOM (used in frameworks like React) allows for more efficient updating by only changing parts of the DOM that need it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Security
    <ul>
        <li>
        Manipulating the DOM with user-supplied data can lead to security issues like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
        </li>
        <li>
        Always sanitize and validate user input before adding it to the DOM.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
    Compatibility
    <ul>
        <li>
        Different browsers may have different implementations of the DOM.
        </li>
        <li>
        Use feature detection to ensure compatibility across browsers.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
</div>
